.SH DESCRIPTION
.B BasText
is a program that is used to convert between binary (tokenized)
BASIC files from the Commodore C64 and C128 to a clean ASCII text
format that is human and machine readable, as well as transportable
via electronic mail.
This program is designed to be compatible with
.BR tok64 ,
while extending the support for Commodore BASIC extensions and
dialects.
.PP
The following Commodore BASIC versions and extensions are supported
by
.BR BasText :
.RS
.PP
.I Commodore BASIC 2.0 (VIC20/C64)
.PD 0
.PP
.I Commodore BASIC 3.5 (C16/+4)
.PP
.I Commodore BASIC 4.0 (PET)
.PP
.I Commodore BASIC 7.0 (C128)
.PP
.I Software Unlimited's Graphics52 for Commodore 64
.PP
.I Riska BV's The Final Cartridge III for Commodore 64
.PP
.I Rick Simon's BASIC 7.1 for Commodore 128
.PP
.I VIC Super Expander for VIC-20
.RE

.B BasText
tries to autodetect the Commodore BASIC dialect used in the file
it is processing.
At the moment, this is done by checking the starting address of the
file.
These starting addresses are recognized, and interpreted (addresses
written in hexadecimal):
.TP
0401
.I VIC-20 BASIC 2.0 (3K RAM expansion)
.TP
0801
.I Commodore 64 BASIC 2.0
.TP
1001
.I Commodore 16/Plus 4 BASIC 3.5 (or unexpanded VIC-20 BASIC 2.0)
.TP
1201
.I VIC-20 BASIC 2.0 (8K RAM expansion)
.TP
132D
.IR "Commodore 128 BASIC 7.1 extension by Rick Simon" .
This file is a combined file, with both the BASIC 7.1
extension binary, and the BASIC source in one file (saved
with BASIC 7.1's
.B ESAVE
command).
The preamble will be ignored, and the file will be
interpreted as BASIC 7.1.
.TP
1C01
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0
.TP
4001
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0
saved with graphics mode enabled.
.SH OPTIONS
One of the three mode selectors must be given:
.TP
.I \-i
Set input mode (converting from binary Commodore tokenized BASIC to
text).
.TP
.I \-o
Set output mode (converting from text to binary Commodore tokenized
BASIC).
.TP
.I \-h
Shows a brief help screen, with an overview of the available options.
.SS "FORMAT SELECTION"
The
.I \-f
option selects the format of the input and output files:
.TP
.I \-f t64
Enable T64 (Commodore 64 emulator tape archive) mode.
When in input mode, this means that instead of the specified file
names being binary Commodore BASIC files, they are T64 archives.
When in output mode, this means that instead of writing the
binary Commodore BASIC files to files in the current directory,
they will be written to a T64 archive named
.B bastext.t64
in the current directory.
If the archive already exists, it will be appended to.
The default directory size for the
.B bastext.t64
file is 30 entries.
If you try to add more files to it, the program will abort with
an error message.
The default directory size is controlled in the
.I t64.h
file.
.TP
.I \-f p00
Enable P00 (PC64 emulator container file) mode.
The Commodore BASIC files are written to the current directory but get a
PC64 container header written to them and a file extension of .p00 added.
This parameter is ignored in input mode, as it will auto-detect the .p00
container format.
.SS "BASIC SELECTION"
The
.I \-b
option selects the BASIC dialect to use; if not specified,
the format is detected automatically, unless otherwise mentioned:
.TP
.I \-b 2.0
Force
.I Commodore BASIC 2.0
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-b 3.5
Force
.I Commodore C16/+4 BASIC 3.5
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-b 7.0
Force
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-b 7.1
Force
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.1 extension
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-b TFC3
Force
.I Commodore 64 The Final Cartridge III BASIC extension
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
(See also
.BR BUGS ).
.TP
.I \-b 52
Force
.I Commodore 64 Graphics52 BASIC extension
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-b X16
Enable Commander X16 BASIC support.
This must be specified in input mode to properly detokenize Commander X16
BASIC binary.
In output mode, the tokx16 header will enable Commander X16 BASIC mode no
matter which BASIC mode has been selected, but -x must be specifid if the
text file uses a standard tok64 header.
.TP
.I \-b Super
Enable VIC-20 Super Expander support.
This must be specified both in input and output mode, as bastext for
compatibility reasons selects the Commodore 64 Graphics52 expansion by
default.
.SS "BEHAVIOURAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.I \-a
Convert all input files, not only those that have a "recognized"
starting address (input mode only).
.TP
.I \-s
Maintain strict compatibility with
.BR tok64 .
This means that
.BR BasText \'s
"extended" escape codes for charactes 92 (British pound),
95 (left arrow), 160\-192 (shift space to shift asterisk),
219\-221 (shift plus, commodore minus and shift minus), and 223
(commodore asterisk), will be printed as three-digit numeric
escape codes, not as textual escapes.
The "strict" mode will not, however, undo the problems with
.BR tok64 's
"uppercase in quoted strings"-bug (see under
.BR BUGS ).
.TP
.IR \-d \ filename
Selects the filename to write the output to.
If the filename is not given, or is given as "-", the listings
will be output on the standard output device (normally the
console).
.PP
Please note that the MS-DOS and OS/2 versions (EMX compiled)
uses
.B /
(slash) as parameter character.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B bastext \-i sample.prg
Converts
.I sample.prg
to text, and displays it on the standard output.
.TP
.B bastext \-i \-s \-d programs.txt *.prg
Converts all Commodore BASIC binary files with a
.I .prg
extension to text, writing it to
.I programs.txt
in the current directory, while maintaining
.B tok64
compatibility.
.TP
.B bastext \-ift64 *.t64 | more
Converts all files in all T64 archives (with filename suffix
.IR .t64 )
in the current directory into listings, displaying them
one page at a time.
.TP
.B bastext \-ob7.0 programs.txt
Converts all programs in the
.I programs.txt
text file into Commodore BASIC 7.0 programs.

.PD
.SH BUGS
.B tok64
seems to parse uppercase characters in quoted strings
incorrectly.
It converts them into characters in the range of 97-122,
whereas a Commodore computer (and
.BR BasText )
usually uses the "shadow" range of 193-208.
This will not look any different when used on a Commodore
computer, but it will make the binaries differ, and could
make a difference if the program needs the correct PETSCII
values.
The problem will appear when you convert the program in
one direction with
.B BasText
and in the other with
.BR tok64 ,
not when using the same program in both directions.
.PP
.B BasText
does not yet support the "bare" format that tok64 normally
outputs (without the
.I start tok64
header).
