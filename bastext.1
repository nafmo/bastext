.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bastext
is a program that is used to convert between binary (tokenized)
BASIC files from the Commodore C64 and C128 to a clean ASCII text
format that is human and machine readable, as well as transportable
via electronic mail.
This program is designed to be compatible with
.BR tok64 ,
while extending the support for Commodore BASIC extensions and
dialects.
.PP
The following Commodore BASIC versions and extensions are supported
by
.BR bastext :
.RS
.PP
.I Commodore BASIC 2.0
.PD 0
.PP
.I Commodore BASIC 7.0
.PP
.I Software Unlimited's Graphics52 for Commodore 64
.PP
.I Riska BV's The Final Cartridge III for Commodore 64
.PP
.I Rick Simon's BASIC 7.1 for Commodore 128
.RE
.PD
.PP
.B bastext
tries to autodetect the Commodore BASIC dialect used in the file
it is processing.
At the moment, this is done by checking the starting address of the
file.
These starting addresses are recognized, and interpreted (addresses
written in hexadecimal):
.TP
0401
.I VIC-20 BASIC 2.0
or
.IR "Commodore 64 Graphics52 BASIC extension" .
Since Graphics52 is the super-set, the file will be interpreted
as such.
.TP
0801
.I Commodore 64 BASIC 2.0
or
.IR "Commodore 64 The Final Cartridge III BASIC extension" .
Since TFC3 is the super-set, the file will be interpreted
as such.
.TP
132D
.IR "Commodore 128 BASIC 7.1 extension by Rick Simon" .
This file is a combined file, with both the BASIC 7.1
extension binary, and the BASIC source in one file (saved
with BASIC 7.1's
.B ESAVE
command).
The preamble will be ignored, and the file will be
interpreted as BASIC 7.1.
.TP
1C01
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0
or
.IR "Commodore 128 BASIC 7.1 extension by Rick Simon" .
Since BASIC 7.1 is the super-set, the file will be
interpreted as such.
.TP
4001
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0
saved with graphics mode enabled.
.PP
The text files created by this program are supposed to be
compatible with those of
.BR tok64 ,
meaning that the files it creates should be possible to
interpret with this one, and the files this program creates
should be possible to interpret with it.
However, an extra header, in front of
.BR tok64 \'s
.I start tok64
header is added,
.IR "start bastext" ,
which contains the starting address of the original binary
file.
This is to make the autodetection possible for the text-to-binary
direction.
The header is not included when the program starts at 0801
(see also
.BR BUGS )
or 1C01.
For Commodore 128 BASIC programs, the header is changed to
.IR "start tok128" ,
since
.B tok64
only supports C64 programs, this will make it skip those
programs.
.PP
When
.B bastext
interprets text representations of files back into binary mode,
it will use the start address as saved in the
.I start bastext
header, to autodetect the file format in the same way as in
binary-to-text.
If no such header exists (e.g if the file was created with
.BR tok64 ),
.B bastext
will assume that the program's start address is 0801
(standard for Commodore 64), and that it should interpret it as
Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0, as this is a super-set of BASIC 2.0.
This should make
.B bastext
able to interpret most text files without any big problems.
If autodetection in this mode does not work, use one of the
"force" parameters described below.
.SH OPTIONS
One of the three mode selectors must be given:
.TP
.I \-i
Set input mode (converting from binary Commodore tokenized BASIC to
text).
.TP
.I \-o
Set output mode (converting from text to binary Commodore tokenized
BASIC).
.TP
.I \-h
Shows a brief help screen, with an overview of the available options.
.SS "GENERAL MODIFIERS"
.PP
These general modifiers (works in both input and output modes)
are available:
.TP
.I \-t
Enable T64 (Commodore 64 emulator tape archive) mode.
When in input mode, this means that instead of the specified file
names being binary Commodore BASIC files, they are T64 archives.
When in output mode, this means that instead of writing the
binary Commodore BASIC files to files in the current directory,
they will be written to a T64 archive named
.B bastext.t64
in the current directory.
If the archive already exists, it will be appended to.
The default directory size for the
.B bastext.t64
file is 30 entries.
If you try to add more files to it, the program will abort with
an error message.
The default directory size is controlled in the
.I t64.h
file.
.SS "INPUT MODE MODIFIERS"
.PP
These modifiers are available only when in input mode:
.TP
.I \-a
Convert all input files, not only those that have a \"recognized\"
starting address.
.TP
.I \-s
Maintain strict compatibility with
.BR tok64 .
This means that
.BR bastext \'s
"extended" escape codes for charactes 92 (British pound),
95 (left arrow), 160\-192 (shift space to shift asterisk),
219\-221 (shift plus, commodore minus and shift minus), and 223
(commodore asterisk), will be printed as three-digit numeric
escape codes, not as textual escapes.
The "strict" mode will not, however, undo the problems with
.BR tok64 's
"uppercase in quoted strings"-bug (see under
.BR BUGS ).
.TP
.I \-d filename
Selects the filename to write the output to.
If the filename is not given, or is given as "-", the listings
will be output on the standard output device (normally the
console).
.SS "OUTPUT MODE MODIFIERS"
.PP
These modifiers are available only when in output mode:
.TP
.I \-2
Force
.I Commodore BASIC 2.0
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-3
Force
.I Commodore 64 The Final Cartridge III BASIC extension
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
(See also
.BR BUGS ).
.TP
.I \-5
Force
.I Commodore 64 Graphics52 BASIC extension
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-7
Force
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.TP
.I \-1
Force
.I Commodore 128 BASIC 7.1 extension
interpretation of
.I all
programs.
.PP
Please note that the MS-DOS and OS/2 versions (EMX compiled)
uses
.B /
(slash) as parameter character.

.SH BUGS
TFC3 BASIC files that are converted to text will not have a
.I start bastext
header, so when converted back to binary, they will be
interpreted as Commodore 128 BASIC 7.0.
You have to use the
.I \-3
option (force TFC3) to convert TFC3 BASIC text files back to
binary.
.PP
.B tok64
seems to parse uppercase characters in quoted strings
incorrectly.
It converts them into characters in the range of 97-122,
whereas a Commodore computer (and
.BR bastext )
usually uses the "shadow" range of 193-208.
This will not look any different when used on a Commodore
computer, but it will make the binaries differ, and could
make a difference if the program needs the correct PETSCII
values.
The problem will appear when you convert the program in
one direction with
.B bastext
and in the other with
.BR tok64 ,
not when using the same program in both directions.
.PP
.B bastext
does not yet support the "bare" format that tok64 normally
outputs (without the
.I start tok64
header).
